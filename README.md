## Hi, I'm Irena ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer specializing in applied machine learning (also a lapsed mathematician, a former data scientist, a writer, and a mother).

My personal projects on Github have mostly come out of classes I've taken at the [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.study/) and, more recently, a batch I did at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Spring 2025. Many of them center around my interests in attention, surveillance, and language - particularly (the appropriate use of) large language models.
